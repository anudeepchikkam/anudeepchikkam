- 👋 Hi, I’m @anudeepchikkam
- 👀 I’m interested in AI- Computer Vision, and the NLP domain.
- 🌱 I’m learning about key-point extraction on human faces and predicting diseases from those features. 
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on computer vision tasks, such as image classification, semantic segmentation, and other CV tasks. I am also interested in building intelligent conventional chatbots.
